<i>“Everything must be made as simple as possible. But not simpler.”</i> ― <b>Albert Einstein</b>.

Philosophy, is the study of the fundamental nature of existence, reality, beliefs and knowledge, especially when considered as a theory or attitude that acts as a guiding principle for acting behaviour. It's also associated with some mental judgement and coming out as an art and sentiment of mathematics, which can give us a capability to justice the subject. That's why I am thinking by using some bits of quantum nature of my mind, so what's the really hell about the <b>Beauty</b>.

What you're thinking, I have really taken it as a stupid promise, No ― Dear ― No. Please continue about the philosophical theorem not the mathatical one. Okay, so what is the beauty, can I cantinue with Oh! Reader. Don't say, yes to me. Say, strongly to you.

Heah, not now, I am judging you ― you're thinking? Okay, Let's start.
